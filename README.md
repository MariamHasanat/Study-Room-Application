# Study Room Application

This is my project for a study room app. It has email/password login, and I recently added Google Sign-In.

## Features

- Login with email and password.
- Login with Google: You can log in with your Google account with one click, and your info will be saved automatically if it’s your first time.

## How to Run

1. Download the project files to your computer.
2. You need a Firebase project. Update the config in `scripts/firebase-config.js` with your own Firebase info.
3. Open `index.html` or `pages/login.html` in your browser.
4. Try logging in with email or by clicking the "Sign in with Google" button.

**Note:**  
Don’t forget to enable Google Sign-In from the Firebase settings (in the console → Authentication → Sign-in method → enable Google).

# Study Room Application

## New Features

### 1. Delete Subject

You can now easily remove any subject from your study list. Each subject in the home page list has a trash icon button. Clicking it will prompt for confirmation and, if accepted, the subject will be deleted from both your local data and the cloud (Firestore).

### 2. Google Authentication

You can now sign in with your Google account! On the login page, simply click the "Sign in with Google" button. This allows for quick and secure access without needing to remember another password. If you sign in with Google for the first time, your profile will be created automatically.

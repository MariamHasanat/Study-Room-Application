## 🚀 Implemented Feature

### Subject Deletion Feature 🗑️
This feature allows users to delete a study subject from their list. Here's how it works:
* A **confirmation prompt** appears to prevent accidental deletions.
* The subject is **immediately removed from the UI and browser's Local Storage** for a quick and responsive experience.
* The change is **synchronized with Firestore** to ensure data consistency across all devices.
